## Prioritized Feature Implementation

### ðŸ”´ High Priority (Critical for usability)
1. **Fix test coverage gaps**
   - Currently at 99.62% (need 100%)
   - Uncovered lines: tasks.ts:421, users.ts:162, logger.ts:38
   
2. **Task assignment features** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Assign users to tasks (already implemented)
   - âœ… Unassign users from tasks (PR #37)
   - âœ… List task assignees separately (list-assignees subcommand)
   
3. **Bulk operations** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Bulk task updates (modify multiple tasks at once)
   - âœ… Bulk task deletion
   - âœ… Efficient batch API calls

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority (Significant value-add)
4. **Advanced filtering** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Save custom task filters
   - âœ… Apply saved filters
   - âœ… Complex query support
   
5. **Task relations** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Link related tasks together (relate/unrelate subcommands)
   - âœ… Manage task dependencies (all relation types supported)
   
6. **Recurring tasks** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Support for repeating tasks (repeatAfter and repeatMode fields)
   - âœ… Recurrence patterns (day, week, month, year)
   
7. **Project archiving** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Archive/unarchive projects
   - âœ… Filter archived projects (already supported in list)
   
8. **Project sharing** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Create/manage project share links
   - âœ… Password protection for shares
   - âœ… Expiration dates for shares
   - âœ… Different permission levels (Read/Write/Admin)
   - âœ… Share authentication for accessing shared projects
   
9. **Project Templates** âœ… Complete
   - âœ… Create templates from existing projects
   - âœ… Variable substitution system
   - âœ… Template management (CRUD operations)
   - âœ… Instantiate new projects from templates
   
10. **Statistics and insights**
    - Project statistics
    - User productivity metrics
    - Task completion trends

### ðŸŸ¢ Lower Priority (Nice-to-have)
11. **Quick add**
    - Natural language task creation
    - Parse due dates from text
    
12. **Import/Export**
    - Batch import from CSV/JSON
    - Export project data
    
13. **Integration tests**
    - Tests with real Vikunja instance
    - End-to-end workflows
    
14. **Response standardization**
    - Consistent formats across operations

## Features Not Planned (Technical Limitations)

These features were identified but cannot be implemented due to technical constraints:

1. **File Attachments**
   - Blocked by MCP protocol limitations
   - MCP doesn't support file upload/download operations
   
2. **Real-time Updates** 
   - Webhooks require persistent connections
   - MCP is request/response based
   
3. **Multi-instance Support**
   - MCP tools operate in single-instance context
   - Would require significant architecture changes

## Long-term Goals (Q3-Q4 2025 and beyond)

### Enhanced Features
1. **Bulk Operations**
   - Bulk task updates
   - Bulk task deletion
   - Batch API calls for efficiency

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Complex query support
   - Saved filters
   - Custom views

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Request caching
   - Parallel API calls where applicable
   - Response compression

### Integration Improvements
1. **Better Node-RED Integration**
   - Shared configuration
   - Event synchronization
   - Workflow templates

2. **AI-Optimized Responses**
   - Summarized responses for large datasets
   - Context-aware information
   - Natural language query support

3. **Real-time Features**
   - Webhook support
   - Live updates
   - Notification handling

## Future Considerations (2026+)

1. **Multi-instance Support**
   - Connection management
   - Instance switching
   - Credential vault

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Task statistics
   - Productivity insights
   - Team performance metrics

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - SSO integration
   - Audit logging
   - Advanced permissions

## Development Principles

- **Quality over Quantity**: Ensure each feature is thoroughly tested
- **API First**: Design for programmatic access
- **AI Friendly**: Optimize for LLM interactions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Minimize breaking changes
- **Security Focus**: Regular security audits

## Success Metrics

- 100% test coverage maintained
- Response time < 500ms for basic operations
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive documentation
- Active community engagement
